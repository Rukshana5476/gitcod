<p>Nature is the beautiful and life-giving gift of our planet. It includes everything around us—trees, rivers, mountains, animals, the sky, and even the air we breathe. Nature provides us with food, water, shelter, and countless resources essential for survival. Its beauty inspires peace and creativity, from the vibrant colors of flowers to the soothing sound of flowing water. However, human activities like deforestation and pollution are harming nature. Protecting it is our responsibility, as a healthy environment ensures a healthy life for all living beings. By caring for nature, we care for our own future.
